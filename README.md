# 🎯 HTML & CSS Landing Pages Collection

This repository contains a growing collection of **HTML and CSS landing pages**, created for practice, inspiration, and experimentation. Each landing page is placed in its own numbered folder (e.g., `01`, `02`, `03`, etc.).

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a **separate landing page project**, and typically contains:

- index.html – The main HTML file
- style.css  – The CSS file used for styling

```bash
/
├── 01/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── style.css
├── 02/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── styles.css
├── 03/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
````

> More folders will be added over time as new pages are built.
